# Assessment & Evaluation Framework

## Overview

This framework provides comprehensive assessment strategies for the Q-Corp GIS Training Program, ensuring learners develop practical skills that support community needs.

---

## Assessment Philosophy

### Principles

**1. Authentic Assessment**
- Evaluate skills in real-world contexts
- Use community-relevant scenarios
- Focus on practical application

**2. Continuous Feedback**
- Formative assessment throughout modules
- Regular check-ins and practice
- Opportunity for revision

**3. Multiple Measures**
- Combination of activities, projects, and demonstrations
- Accommodate different learning styles
- Value both process and product

**4. Cultural Relevance**
- Honor Yup'ik knowledge systems
- Include traditional knowledge integration
- Respect community priorities

---

## Assessment Types

### 1. Pre-Assessment

**Purpose:** Establish baseline skills and identify needs

**Tools:**
- Skills inventory questionnaire
- Technology comfort survey
- Prior GIS experience assessment

**Example Questions:**
- Have you used mapping software before?
- How comfortable are you with smartphones/tablets?
- What mapping needs does your work have?
- Do you have experience with GPS devices?

### 2. Formative Assessment (During Learning)

**Purpose:** Monitor progress and provide feedback

**Methods:**

#### Quick Checks
- End-of-lesson questions
- Peer teaching moments
- Live polls during instruction
- Demonstration of specific skills

#### Progress Tracking
- Daily skill checklist
- Self-assessment forms
- Instructor observations
- Peer feedback

#### Practice Activities
- Guided exercises
- Troubleshooting challenges
- Mini-projects

---

### 3. Summative Assessment (End of Module)

**Purpose:** Evaluate mastery of learning objectives

**Methods:**

#### Module Completion Projects
- Complete, functional deliverable
- Demonstrates core competencies
- Real-world application

#### Skill Demonstrations
- Perform tasks without guidance
- Explain process to others
- Troubleshoot problems independently

#### Reflective Writing
- Analyze learning experience
- Connect to community needs
- Plan future applications

---

### 4. Final Project Assessment

**Purpose:** Integrate skills across all modules

**Requirements:**
- Addresses real community need
- Uses multiple GIS technologies
- Includes data collection, analysis, and presentation
- Demonstrates independent problem-solving
