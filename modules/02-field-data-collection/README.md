# Module 2: Field Data Collection

## Documenting Typhoon Damage Using ESRI Field Tools

**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Prerequisites:** Module 1 (ArcGIS Online Basics)  
**Setting:** Red Building and surrounding community infrastructure

---

## Overview

This module teaches you how to collect, document, and share field data using mobile GIS tools. You'll learn through a real-world scenario: documenting damage from the October 2025 typhoon that impacted Quinhagak and surrounding communities.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to collect accurate geographic data in the field, even without internet connection, and create maps that support community decision-making.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. ✅ Design and deploy a mobile damage survey using **Survey123** and **ArcGIS Field Maps**
2. ✅ Collect geotagged photos, videos, and damage assessments directly from the field
3. ✅ Work offline using downloaded map areas
4. ✅ Integrate **Emlid Reach RS3** GNSS receiver for sub-meter GPS accuracy
5. ✅ Sync collected data to **ArcGIS Online**
6. ✅ Publish results using **ArcGIS Dashboards** or **StoryMaps**
7. ✅ Create a community-facing "Typhoon Recovery Map"

---

## Real-World Scenario

**The Challenge:** After the October 2025 typhoon, the land manager must document damage to critical infrastructure and subsistence areas. This information will be shared with the Qanirtuuq Incorporated Board, Nalaquq technicians, and state emergency partners.

**What to Document:**
- Damage to roads, airstrip, docks, and public buildings
- Erosion and flooding along the Qanirtuuq River and coast
- Impacts to subsistence areas (fish camps, drying racks, berry patches)

**The Goal:** Create a comprehensive damage assessment layer that supports recovery planning and funding requests.

- Test your survey before going to the field
- Include helpful hints in question descriptions
- Make required fields obvious

### Offline Workflows
- Download maps while connected to Wi-Fi
- Verify map scale and detail levels
- Test offline sync before leaving town
- Carry backup power for devices

### Field Photography
- Take multiple angles of each site
- Include reference objects for scale
- Label photos with short descriptions
- Keep lens clean (especially in rain/snow)

### Data Quality
- Be consistent in how you classify damage
- Fill out all required fields completely
- Double-check coordinates and accuracy
- Review data before syncing

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Survey won't download to mobile device**
- Check internet connection
- Verify you're signed in to the correct account
- Try refreshing the survey list
- [See detailed guide →](./troubleshooting/survey-download.md)

**GPS accuracy is poor (>5 meters)**
- Move away from buildings and trees
- Wait for more satellites (15+ recommended)
- Consider using external GNSS receiver
- [See detailed guide →](./troubleshooting/gps-accuracy.md)

**Data won't sync to ArcGIS Online**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify storage space on device
- Check for conflicting edits
- [See detailed guide →](./troubleshooting/sync-issues.md)

**Offline maps are too large to download**
- Reduce the map extent/area
- Lower the detail level
- Remove unnecessary layers
- [See detailed guide →](./troubleshooting/offline-storage.md)
