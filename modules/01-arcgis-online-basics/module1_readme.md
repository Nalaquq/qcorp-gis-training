## Overview

This module introduces you to ArcGIS Online, ESRI's cloud-based GIS platform. You'll learn the fundamentals through a real-world scenario: documenting changes to Quinhagak's gravel pits over time using historical satellite imagery.

By the end of this module, you'll know how to access satellite imagery, create maps, and share your findings with community partners through professional web maps and Story Maps.

---

## Real-World Scenario

**The Task:** Warren Jones (community partner) needs before-and-after satellite images of gravel pits near the old airport and existing pits. This documentation supports land management decisions and historical records.

**What You'll Learn:**
- Find historical satellite imagery (1970s to present)
- Compare landscape changes over time
- Create visualizations (dashboards, Story Maps, maps)
- Share findings with stakeholders

**Example Result:** [Gravel Pit Comparison (1992 vs 2024)](https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landsatexplorer/#mapCenter=-161.86398%2C59.76442%2C14.468&mode=swipe&mainScene=2024-07-02%7CNatural+Color+for+Visualization%7C9422507&secondaryScene=1992-06-24%7CNatural+Color+for+Visualization%7C2625814)

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Working with Satellite Imagery
- **Be patient** - Historical imagery may take time to load
- **Check multiple dates** - Not all years have good coverage
- **Consider seasons** - Summer images show more detail (less snow)
- **Note cloud cover** - Choose clearest available images
- **Save coordinates** - Bookmark exact locations for consistency

### Creating Effective Maps
- **Start simple** - Add complexity gradually
- **Use appropriate basemaps** - Imagery for satellite comparison, streets for navigation
- **Label clearly** - Use Yup'ik and English place names
- **Think about audience** - Community members vs. technical staff
- **Test sharing** - Verify others can access your maps

### Story Map Best Practices
- **Tell a story** - Beginning, middle, end
- **Use visuals** - More images, less text
- **Add context** - Explain why this matters
- **Include community voice** - Quotes from elders or stakeholders
- **Keep it focused** - One clear message

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Can't access ArcGIS Online**
