## Teaching Strategies

### For Beginners

**Key Challenges:**
- Information overload (too many tools, options)
- Technology anxiety
- Confusion about cloud vs. desktop
- Understanding spatial data concepts

**Strategies:**
1. **One thing at a time** - Don't show all features at once
2. **Repetition** - Demonstrate, then guide, then independent practice
3. **Analogies** - Compare to familiar things (folders like file cabinet)
4. **Celebrate small wins** - "You just created your first web map!"
5. **Normalize mistakes** - Share your own learning curve

### Demonstration Techniques

**Live Demos:**
- **Slow down** - Students need time to follow along
- **Think aloud** - Narrate your decision-making
- **Pause often** - "Everyone see that?" "Any questions?"
- **Show mistakes** - Demonstrate recovery from errors
- **Use large fonts** - Zoom browser to 125%+ for projection

**Screen Recording:**
- Record demos for students to review later
- Post recordings in shared folder
- Include narration explaining steps

### Managing Different Skill Levels

**Challenge:**
Some students may have used Google Maps, others have never done anything beyond basic email.

**Solutions:**
1. **Pair experienced with beginners** - peer teaching
2. **Provide extension activities** - "If you finish early, try..."
3. **Offer extra help sessions** - Optional office hours
4. **Use breakout support** - Advanced students work independently while you help beginners
5. **Multiple pathways** - "Try this simpler version first" vs. "Here's an advanced option"

## Real-World Context: The Gravel Pit Task

### Warren's Original Request

**Context:** Warren Jones needed before/after documentation of gravel pits for:
- Board presentations
- Historical records
- Land management planning
- Potential grant applications

**This was perfect for training because:**
- Real need (not hypothetical)
- Immediate value (Warren used the results)
- Clear deliverable (shareable URL)
- Visible impact (before/after obvious)
- Community relevant

### How to Present This

**Introduction:**
"Warren Jones, who works with Qanirtuuq Inc., came to us with a real need: document how the gravel pits near the old airport have changed over the past 30 years. Today, you're going to learn how to do exactly what we did for Warren—and you'll be able to use these same skills for other land management needs."

**Throughout the lesson:**
- Reference Warren's needs
- Show the actual results delivered
- Explain how it was used
- Connect to other potential applications

**Key Message:**
This isn't just a training exercise—this is real work that supports the community.

## Common Student Challenges

### Challenge 1: Finding Good Satellite Imagery

**Symptoms:**
- Frustrated with clouds in images
- Can't find clear summer imagery
- Confused about which dates to use

**Solutions:**
- Pre-scout good dates for Quinhagak
- Provide date range suggestions: "Try June-August 1990-1995"
- Explain that some gaps/clouds are normal
- Show how to document limitations
- Emphasize: use best available, note quality issues

**Teaching Tip:**
Create a "cheat sheet" with known good dates for Quinhagak area.

---

### Challenge 2: Web Map Styling Confusion

**Symptoms:**
- Maps look cluttered or ugly
- Too many layers
- Colors don't make sense
- Can't figure out layer order

**Solutions:**
- Start with ONE layer, style it well
- Demonstrate before/after of good styling
- Show how layer order matters
- Provide color scheme suggestions
- Emphasize: simple is better

**Teaching Tip:**
Have example of "bad map" and "good map" to compare.

---

### Challenge 3: Story Map Structure

**Symptoms:**
- Jumps around without clear flow
- Too much text, not enough visuals
- Or opposite: all images, no context
- Unclear message

**Solutions:**
- Provide story outline template
- Show examples of well-structured Story Maps
- Encourage outlining before building
- Review structure before they start building
- Peer review process

**Teaching Tip:**
Make them write a 1-page outline before touching Story Maps interface.

---

### Challenge 4: Technical Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Can't sign in
- Page won't load
- Map won't save
- "Error" messages

**Solutions:**
- Have troubleshooting checklist visible
- Common fixes: refresh page, try different browser, sign out/in
- Clear browser cache
- Check internet connection
- Have backup accounts ready
- Be patient - technology glitches happen

**Teaching Tip:**
Normalize technical issues: "This happens to everyone, even experienced GIS professionals. Let's troubleshoot together."

---

## Cultural Considerations

### Language

**Yup'ik Place Names:**
- Ask students for correct Yup'ik names
- Use both Yup'ik and English throughout
- Create glossary if helpful
- Respect traditional naming

**Technical Terms:**
- Explain jargon clearly
- Use plain language when possible
- Create glossary of terms
- Check for understanding

### Learning Approach

**Yup'ik Pedagogy:**
- Emphasize observation and practice
- Allow time for mastery before moving on
- Value hands-on learning
- Learn by doing, not just listening
- Peer teaching is culturally appropriate
- Patience with learning pace

### Community Context

**Sensitive Topics:**
- Some locations may be culturally sensitive
- Ask before using certain areas as examples
- Respect privacy of specific sites
- Consider who will see shared maps
- Discuss appropriate sharing levels

**Traditional Knowledge:**
- Acknowledge elders' expertise about landscape
- Satellite imagery complements (doesn't replace) traditional knowledge
- Opportunity to document traditional knowledge digitally
- Respect protocols about knowledge sharing

---

## Assessment Strategies

### Formative Assessment (During Learning)

**Quick Checks:**
- "Show me where to click to..."
- "What would you do next?"
- "Why might we choose this basemap?"

**Observation:**
Watch for:
- Can they navigate independently?
- Are they waiting for permission or exploring?
- Do they help each other?
- Are they engaged or frustrated?

**Exit Tickets:**
End each session with:
1. One thing you learned today
2. One question you still have
3. One way you might use this

### Summative Assessment (End of Module)

**Grading Philosophy:**
- Focus on understanding, not perfection
- Value effort and improvement
- Consider starting skill level
- Practical application matters most

**Don't Penalize:**
- Technology glitches
- Learning curve issues
- English language errors (if communication is clear)
- Different aesthetic choices

**Do Look For:**
- Completion of required elements
- Understanding of core concepts
- Appropriate use of tools
- Thoughtful decision-making
- Improvement from start to finish

## Real Results from October 1, 2025 Training

### What Worked Well

**Positive Feedback:**
- Gravel pit task was engaging and relevant
- Wayback imagery was "eye-opening"
- Quick wins (seeing results same day)
- Real application (Warren actually used it)

**Effective Strategies:**
- Starting with account setup all together
- Live demonstration then independent practice
- Having Warren provide context about task
- Allowing peer collaboration

### What to Improve

**Challenges Encountered:**
- Initial confusion about Wayback interface
- Some students wanted more time with each tool
- Story Map building took longer than expected
- Need clearer instructions for finding imagery dates

**For Next Time:**
- Provide pre-selected "good" imagery dates
- Create more detailed Story Map template
- Allow more time for Activity 4
- Record demos for later review
- Have more examples ready

---

## Backup Plans

### If Internet Fails

**Immediate actions:**
1. Switch to offline activities (not possible for this module)
2. Use hotspot from phone
3. Focus on theory and examples
4. Reschedule practical work

**Prevention:**
- Test internet thoroughly before session
- Have backup connectivity (mobile hotspot)
- Download key materials in advance
- Have paper activities ready

### If Students Can't Access Accounts

**Causes:**
- Account setup delays
- Password issues
- Organization problems
- License availability

**Solutions:**
- Have a few "demo" accounts ready
- Students can share accounts temporarily
- Contact ArcGIS Online support
- Move to different activity while resolving

### If Technology Doesn't Cooperate

**Examples:**
- Projector fails
- Training computers don't work
- ArcGIS Online is down

**Backup:**
- Use students' devices if available
- Show on individual screens instead of projecting
- Switch to whiteboard/discussion
- Use paper handouts more heavily
