## ArcGIS Online vs. Other Mapping Tools

### How It Compares

| Feature | Google Maps | ArcGIS Online |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| View maps | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Basic navigation | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Add your own data | ❌ Limited | ✅ Full control |
| Professional analysis | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Custom styling | ❌ Limited | ✅ Complete |
| Share with specific people | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Mobile data collection | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Survey123, Field Maps) |
| Historical imagery | ✅ Some | ✅ Extensive |
| Print quality maps | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Technical support | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

**Bottom line:** Google Maps is great for finding directions. ArcGIS Online is for professional GIS work.
