## Why Satellite Imagery Matters

### The Power of Seeing from Above

Imagine being able to see Quinhagak from space, not just today, but also 10, 20, or 30 years ago. Satellite imagery lets you:

**Document Changes:**
- How has the village grown?
- Where has erosion occurred?
- What infrastructure was added?

**Support Decisions:**
- Where should new buildings go?
- Which areas are most vulnerable to flooding?
- How are subsistence areas changing?

**Communicate Visually:**
- Show rather than tell
- Make impacts obvious
- Support traditional knowledge with visual evidence

**Save Time and Money:**
- No need to fly a plane for aerial photos
- Access decades of historical images
- Free for most applications

## Understanding Satellite Imagery

### What is It?

**Satellite imagery** = Photos of Earth taken from satellites orbiting in space

### How It Works

```
1. Satellite orbits Earth at specific altitude
   ↓
2. Sensors capture images as it passes over
   ↓
3. Data transmitted to ground stations
   ↓
4. Images processed and made available
   ↓
5. You access through web tools!
```

### Key Concepts

**Resolution:** How much detail you can see
- **High resolution** (1-5 meters) - Can see individual buildings
- **Medium resolution** (10-30 meters) - Can see roads, large structures
- **Low resolution** (>30 meters) - General landscape patterns

**Spectral Bands:** Different "colors" of light captured
- **Natural Color** - Looks like a regular photo
- **Infrared** - Shows vegetation health
- **Other bands** - For specialized analysis

**Temporal Coverage:** When images were taken
- Some satellites: daily images
- Others: every few weeks
- Historical archives: back to 1970s

## Three Essential Tools

### 1. Landsat Explorer

**What:** NASA's long-running satellite program
**Coverage:** Global, 1972-present
**Resolution:** 30 meters (decent detail)
**Best for:** Long-term historical analysis

**Access:** https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landsatexplorer/

**Strengths:**
- Longest historical record
- Consistent imagery since 1980s
- Multiple visualization options
- Scientific-grade data

**Limitations:**
- Lower resolution than modern satellites
- May have cloud cover
- Not all dates available

---

### 2. Esri Wayback Imagery

**What:** Esri's collection of the best available imagery
**Coverage:** Global, typically 2012-present (varies by location)
**Resolution:** Varies, often high resolution (1-2 meters)
**Best for:** Recent changes, before/after comparisons

**Access:** https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/wayback/

**Strengths:**
- Easy swipe comparison tool
- High resolution recent imagery
- Simple interface
- Great for presentations

**Limitations:**
- Shorter time frame than Landsat
- Not all years available everywhere
- May mix different satellites

---

### 3. Copernicus Browser

**What:** European Space Agency's Sentinel satellites
**Coverage:** Global, 2015-present
**Resolution:** 10 meters
**Best for:** Recent, detailed analysis

**Access:** https://browser.dataspace.copernicus.eu/

**Strengths:**
- Very frequent updates (every 5 days)
- Free and open data
- Multiple sensor types
- Advanced analysis options

**Limitations:**
- Shorter history (2015+)
- More complex interface
- Requires more learning

---

## Hands-On: Using Esri Wayback

### Step 1: Open Wayback

1. Go to: https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/wayback/
2. Wait for imagery to load
3. Interface shows current satellite view

### Step 2: Navigate to Quinhagak

**Using Search:**
1. Click **Search icon** (magnifying glass, top right)
2. Type: `Quinhagak, Alaska`
3. Select from results
4. Map automatically zooms to location

**Manual Navigation:**
1. Click and drag to pan
2. Scroll wheel or +/- buttons to zoom
3. Find Kuskokwim Bay area
4. Locate Quinhagak on coast

**Pro Tip:** Bookmark your location for easy return!

### Step 3: Understanding the Timeline

**Left Side Panel:**
- Shows available imagery dates
- Each date = one image set
- Dates in **bold** = imagery available for Quinhagak area

**How to Use:**
1. Drag timeline slider up and down
2. Click on specific dates
3. Watch imagery update
4. Note the date displayed

**What You'll Notice:**
- Not every year has coverage
- More images in recent years
- Summer images are clearer (less snow)

### Step 4: Select Good Imagery

**Quality Factors:**

**Season:**
- ✅ **Summer (June-August)** - Best visibility
- ⚠️ **Spring/Fall** - Partial snow cover
- ❌ **Winter** - Heavy snow obscures features

**Cloud Cover:**
- ✅ **Clear** - All features visible
- ⚠️ **Partial clouds** - Some areas obscured
- ❌ **Heavy clouds** - Most features hidden

**Image Quality:**
- ✅ **Sharp and clear** - Good for analysis
- ⚠️ **Slightly blurry** - Usable but not ideal
- ❌ **Very blurry** - Poor quality, try different date

**Practice:** Find the clearest summer image from 2024

### Step 5: Zoom Levels

Different zoom levels show different details:

**Zoomed Out (Village-wide):**
- See entire community layout
- Understand overall geography
- Compare major landscape features

**Medium Zoom (Neighborhood-level):**
- Individual buildings visible
- Roads and infrastructure
- Changes to specific areas

**Zoomed In (Building-level):**
- Individual structures clearly visible
- Parking areas, equipment
- Detailed features

**Practice:** Zoom to three different levels, note what you can see

## Comparing Time Periods

### Enable Compare Mode

1. Click **"Compare"** button in toolbar
2. Choose comparison type:
   - **Swipe** - Drag bar left/right
   - **Side-by-side** - Two images next to each other

### Set Up Comparison

**Left Side (Before):**
1. Select earlier date (e.g., 1992)
2. Position on area of interest

**Right Side (After):**
1. Select recent date (e.g., 2024)
2. Match position to left side

### Using Swipe Tool

1. Vertical bar appears in middle
2. **Drag left** - See "before" image
3. **Drag right** - See "after" image
4. Repeat back and forth to see changes

**What to Look For:**
- New buildings or infrastructure
- Erosion or land loss
- Vegetation changes
- Development patterns
- Road construction

## Tips for Effective Use

### Finding Good Imagery

**Do:**
- ✅ Check multiple dates around your target year
- ✅ Prefer summer imagery (June-August)
- ✅ Note the date you're using
- ✅ Save coordinates of important locations
- ✅ Test different zoom levels

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use cloudy imagery if better option exists
- ❌ Mix dates when making comparisons
- ❌ Forget to note image quality limitations
- ❌ Rely on winter imagery for detail

### Understanding Limitations

**Imagery Can't Show:**
- What's inside buildings
- Underground features
- What happened between image dates
- Small objects (below resolution)
- Details obscured by clouds/snow

**Be Honest About:**
- Image quality issues
- Uncertain interpretations
- Missing time periods
- Resolution limitations

### Cultural Sensitivity

**Remember:**
- Some areas may be culturally sensitive
- Traditional knowledge complements imagery
- Consult elders about changes observed
- Respect privacy of specific locations
- Share appropriately with community

## Using Landsat Explorer

### Quick Start

1. Go to: https://livingatlas.arcgis.com/landsatexplorer/
2. Interface loads with current imagery
3. Search for Quinhagak (same as Wayback)

### Key Differences from Wayback

**Timeline:**
- Goes back to 1972 (much older!)
- More complete historical coverage
- Better for long-term analysis

**Visualization Options:**
- Natural Color (looks like regular photo)
- Agriculture (shows vegetation health)
- Short-Wave Infrared (highlights water)
- Other specialized views

### When to Use Landsat

**Best for:**
- Historical analysis (1970s-1980s)
- Consistent time series
- Scientific analysis
- Large area comparisons

**Not ideal for:**
- Seeing individual buildings (lower resolution)
- Very recent imagery (Wayback is newer)
- High-detail work
