**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Prerequisites:** Lessons 1-3 completed

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Understand what Story Maps are and when to use them
2. Choose the right Story Map format for your message
3. Create a basic Story Map combining maps, text, and media

## What is a Story Map?

### Simple Definition

A **Story Map** combines:
- **Maps** (showing where)
- **Narrative** (explaining what/why/how)
- **Media** (photos, videos, audio)

Into a **compelling story** that anyone can understand.

### Why Use Story Maps?

**Traditional Reports:**
- Text-heavy, boring
- Maps separate from narrative
- Hard to understand
- Limited engagement

**Story Maps:**
- Visual and engaging
- Maps integrated with story
- Easy to understand
- High engagement
- Shareable online

**Perfect for:**
- Community presentations
- Grant applications
- Educational content
- Historical documentation
- Environmental advocacy
- Progress reports
- Cultural preservation

## Story Maps vs Web Maps

### Key Differences

| Feature | Web Map | Story Map |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Focus | Geography | Narrative + Geography |
| Content | Mainly visual | Text, maps, media combined |
| Structure | Single map | Multiple sections/chapters |
| Purpose | Show locations | Tell a story |
| Audience | Familiar with maps | Anyone |
| Best for | Technical analysis | Communication |

**Think of it this way:**
- **Web Map** = Photo album
- **Story Map** = Photo book with captions and narrative

---

## Types of Story Maps

### 1. Story Map (Basic/Cascade)

**Best for:**
- Long-form narratives
- Scrolling experiences
- Immersive stories
- Multiple sections

**Example use:**
- "History of Quinhagak Gravel Extraction"
- "Erosion Impact on Subsistence Areas"

### 2. Map Tour

**Best for:**
- Location-based tours
- Multiple points of interest
- Guided exploration

**Example use:**
- "Historic Sites in Quinhagak"
- "Infrastructure Tour for Visitors"

### 3. Map Journal

**Best for:**
- Side-by-side map and narrative
- Step-by-step stories
- Before/after comparisons

**Example use:**
- "Quinhagak Development 1990-2025"
- "Typhoon Damage Assessment"

### 4. Swipe/Spyglass

**Best for:**
- Comparing two maps
- Before/after scenarios
- Change detection

**Example use:**
- "Gravel Pits: Then and Now"
- "Shoreline Changes Over Time"

### 5. Shortlist

**Best for:**
- Presenting options
- Comparing locations

3. Images/maps (visual interest)
4. Body text (detailed information)

### Color and Style

**Themes:**
- Choose color scheme that matches message
- Serious topic = subdued colors
- Celebration = vibrant colors
- Professional = blues/grays

**Consistency:**
- Same fonts throughout
- Consistent spacing
- Similar image styles
- Predictable structure

### White Space

**Don't overcrowd:**
- Let content breathe
- Break up long text blocks
- Use images to create breaks
- Balance content and empty space
