**Module:** 01 - ArcGIS Online Basics  
**Activity Type:** Real-World Task  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Prerequisites:** Activity 1 completed, ArcGIS Online account active

## Activity Overview

This is a real task requested by Warren Jones: document the changes to Quinhagak's gravel pits over time using historical satellite imagery. This analysis supports land management decisions and provides visual documentation for stakeholders.

### What You'll Create

A before-and-after satellite imagery comparison showing:
- **1990s imagery** - Land before major gravel extraction
- **2024 imagery** - Current state of gravel pits
- **Side-by-side comparison** - Easy visualization of changes
- **Documented findings** - Report on changes observed

### Real-World Application

This same workflow can document:
- Infrastructure development over time
- Erosion patterns along rivers/coast
- Vegetation changes
- Building expansion in the village
- Changes to subsistence areas

## Part 3: Find "Before" Imagery (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Identify Baseline Date

We want imagery from **before major gravel extraction**, ideally:
- 1980s-early 1990s
- Clear visibility (minimal clouds/snow)
- Summer months preferred (more visible features)

### Step 2: Search Historical Timeline

1. Drag timeline slider to **1990s** section
2. Click on each available date
3. For each date, check:
   - Cloud cover (want minimal)
   - Snow cover (less is better)
   - Image clarity
   - Season (summer images show more)

**Recommended dates to try:**
- June 24, 1992
- Summer months 1989-1995
- Any available 1980s imagery

### Step 3: Locate Gravel Pit Area

**Using the 1992 imagery:**

1. Find the **old airport/airstrip**
   - Long cleared area
   - Usually east of main village
   - Parallel cleared strip

2. Look for **undisturbed areas** near airport
   - Natural tundra vegetation
   - No visible excavation
   - Original land contours

3. **Take notes:**
   ```
   Date of image: _______________
   Season: _______________
   Cloud cover: None / Some / Significant
   
   Observations:
   - Airport condition: _______________
   - Surrounding land: _______________
   - Visible development: _______________
   ```

### Step 4: Capture "Before" Screenshot

1. Zoom to show **both airport and future pit area**
2. Take screenshot showing:
   - Full area of interest
   - Date visible on screen
   - Clear view of land features
3. Save as: `gravel_pit_before_1992.png`

**Pro Tip:** Take multiple screenshots at different zoom levels

---

## Part 4: Find "After" Imagery (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Identify Current Date

We want the **most recent imagery** showing current state:
- 2023-2024 preferred
- Clear conditions
- Summer for visibility

### Step 2: Navigate to Recent Imagery

1. Drag timeline slider to **top** (most recent)
2. Click on **2024** or most recent available
3. Check image quality and clarity

**Recommended dates to try:**
- July 2, 2024 (example from email)
- Summer 2023 or 2024
- Most recent clear image

### Step 3: Identify Changes

**Looking at the same area, note:**

1. **Gravel pit extent**
   - How large is excavated area?
   - Shape and boundaries
   - Active vs. inactive sections

2. **Airport condition**
   - Still in use?
   - Changes to runway
   - New development nearby

3. **Surrounding impacts**
   - Roads created
   - Storage areas
   - Changed drainage patterns
   - Vegetation removal

### Step 4: Document Observations

```
Date of image: _______________

Gravel Pit Observations:
- Approximate size: _______________
- Location relative to airport: _______________
- Visible excavation depth: Yes / No / Unclear
- Active extraction signs: Yes / No

Infrastructure Changes:
- Roads created: _______________
- Equipment visible: Yes / No
- Storage areas: Yes / No

Environmental Changes:
- Vegetation removed (estimate): _______________
- Drainage patterns changed: Yes / No
- Other impacts: _______________
```

### Step 5: Capture "After" Screenshot

1. **Keep same zoom level** as "before" image
2. Take screenshot of **same area**
3. Save as: `gravel_pit_after_2024.png`

## Part 5: Create Comparison (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Enable Swipe Comparison

1. In Wayback Imagery Viewer, click **"Compare"** button
2. Select **"Swipe"** mode
3. Two images will appear side-by-side

### Step 2: Set Up Comparison

**Left side (Before):**
1. Use timeline to select **1992** (or your chosen date)
2. Verify it's positioned correctly

**Right side (After):**
1. Use timeline to select **2024** (or your chosen date)
2. Match the position to left side

### Step 3: Use Swipe Tool

1. **Vertical swipe bar** appears in middle
2. Drag the bar **left and right**
3. Watch the landscape change before your eyes!

### Step 4: Zoom to Key Features

Focus on:
1. **Gravel pit location** - Show extraction extent
2. **Airport area** - Show development
3. **Access roads** - Show new infrastructure

For each area:
- Swipe back and forth
- Take notes on changes
- Capture screenshots

### Step 5: Get Shareable URL

1. Click **"Share"** button
2. Copy the generated URL
3. Test it in a new browser tab
4. Save URL in your notes

**Example URL format:**
```

## Tips for Success

### Finding Good Imagery
- **Summer is best** - More visible features
- **Check multiple years** - Find clearest images
- **Note limitations** - Cloud cover, snow, resolution
- **Be flexible** - May not have perfect dates

### Documenting Changes
- **Be specific** - "Approximately 200m x 300m area" not "big area"
- **Use references** - "Size of 3 football fields"
- **Note uncertainty** - "Appears to be..." when not certain
- **Multiple screenshots** - Different angles and zoom levels

### Communicating Findings
- **Start with big picture** - What changed overall?
- **Then add details** - Specific measurements and observations
- **Use visuals** - More images, less text
- **Consider audience** - Board members may not be GIS experts

- Check different seasons
- Accept some cloud cover if necessary
- Document limitations in your report

### Issue: Swipe Tool Not Working

**Solutions:**
- Refresh browser page
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Ensure both dates are loaded
- Check internet connection

### Issue: Can't Identify Gravel Pit Location

**Solutions:**
- Start with current imagery (pit is obvious)
- Note coordinates of current pit
- Go back in time to same coordinates
- Ask instructor or Warren for help locating

### Issue: Dates Don't Match Example

**Solutions:**
- That's okay! Use best available imagery
- Document which dates you used
- Explain why you chose those dates
- Note any limitations
